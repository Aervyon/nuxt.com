Firstly, on behalf of the Nuxt team, I would like to wish you all a Happy Nuxt Year âœ¨.

In January 2023, [Daniel Roe](https://github.com/danielroe) wrote [**Nuxt: A vision for 2023**](/blog/vision-2023). We achieved most of the goals we set out to accomplish. Some are them are missing and we will tackle them this year!

It was a productive year and the team shipped **9 minor releases**: from v3.1 to v3.9.

As you know, when building Nuxt 3, [Pooya Parsa](https://github.com/pi0) and the team created standalone packages for each part of Nuxt so that the web community could benefit from our innovations. These packages are part of the [UnJS](https://unjs.io) ecosystem and now count **56 packages**. Among them, we saw [jiti](https://unjs.io/packages/jiti) being used by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and even [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) used by [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/getting-started/what-is-solidstart) as well as [AnalogJS](https://analogjs.org/docs/features/api/overview).

In 365 days, Nuxt 3 reached new milestones:

- :icon{name="i-ph-star-duotone"} **49,5K stars** on GitHub ([add yours](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) ðŸ˜Š)
- :icon{name="i-ph-download-duotone"}  **27M downloads** on npm
- :icon{name="i-ph-user-circle-plus-duotone"} **612 contributors** on the [nuxt repository](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt)
- :icon{name="i-ph-puzzle-piece-duotone"} **184 modules** created by **142 maintainers**
- :icon{name="i-ph-check-circle-duotone"} **2,423 closed issues**
- :icon{name="i-ph-git-pull-request-duotone"} **1,728 merged pull request**
- **26,300 members** :Icon{name="i-simple-icons-disco"} on [Discord]()

End of October, Nuxt 3 downloads [surpassed Nuxt 2 downloads](https://twitter.com/Atinux/status/1731980841142669379) ðŸš€.

The same month, we released [Nuxt Image 1.0](https://image.nuxt.com) with Nuxt 3 support and new features to make sure your website stays performant when using Images. Nuxt now auto-installs it as soon as you start using the [`<NuxtImg>`](/docs/api/components/nuxt-img) or [`<NuxtPicture>`](/docs/api/components/nuxt-picture) component.

We shipped [Nuxt DevTools](/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0), leveling up the Developer Experience we can expect from a Web framework. I am happy to see that we inspired other frameworks to adopt a similar approach: [Vue DevTools](https://twitter.com/vuejs/status/1741032977919053865), [Next DevTools](https://twitter.com/xinyao27/status/1741447261132145133), [Remix DevTools](https://twitter.com/AlemTuzlak59192/status/1741903214860009539), [Vite Plugin DevTools](https://github.com/pheno-agency/vite-plugin-devtools), [Astro Dev Toolbar](https://twitter.com/n_moore/status/1732164645778071888) and more.

After many months of building our UI library internally, [Benjamin Canac](https://github.com/benjamincanac) released [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) to let you create websites at a faster pace with highly customizable components built with TailwindCSS.

[Nuxt Content](http://content.nuxt.com) had 10 minor releases with various improvements: from performance to the MDC syntax. We have some ongoing work to better support [edge rendering](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge) in the future. At the same time, the NuxtLabs team is working on [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio) to let users edit Markdown files with a Notion-like editor while keeping your content inside your git repository.

## Vision for 2024
