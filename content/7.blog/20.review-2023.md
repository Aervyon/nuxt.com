## What we shipped

It was still a productive year and the team shipped **9 minor releases for Nuxt 3** and **2 minor releases for Nuxt 2**.



We shipped the [Nuxt DevTools](/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0), something to level up the Developer Experience that I did not see on any other framework that I know of. It am pleased to see that we other web frameworks inspired by it: [Vue DevTools](https://twitter.com/vuejs/status/1741032977919053865), [Next DevTools](https://twitter.com/xinyao27/status/1741447261132145133), [Remix DevTools](https://twitter.com/AlemTuzlak59192/status/1741903214860009539), [Vite Plugin DevTools](https://github.com/pheno-agency/vite-plugin-devtools), [Astro Dev Toolbar](https://twitter.com/n_moore/status/1732164645778071888) and more.
